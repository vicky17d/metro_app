Metro track app

The app is called Track-it!. It is for weekly updates. A team-member can login and update what he did during the last week. The manager can go to current week's home page and see who has updated the status and who has not done yet.
On the user or the week page, you can go left and right and explore. You will understand what exactly is happening.
On a week's page, you can go left and right to see what each user did
On a user's page, you can go left and right to see what the user did in this week and previous weeks.

If you are a person who is updating the status, you need to check 'Update done?' checkbox on the right side where you are updating current week's task. and that would change your status on the week's home page.

There are a lot of things that still need to be done. This is just a POC.
